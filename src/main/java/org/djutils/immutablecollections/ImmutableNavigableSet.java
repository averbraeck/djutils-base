 * A {@link ImmutableSortedSet} extended with navigation methods reporting closest matches for given search targets. Methods
 * {@code lower}, {@code floor}, {@code ceiling}, and {@code higher} return elements respectively less than, less than or equal,
 * greater than or equal, and greater than a given element, returning {@code null} if there is no such element. All methods from
 * java.util.NavigableSet that can change the set have been left out.
